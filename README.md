This article in SDTimes discusses several keys that are crucially important to a successful AI development, and high-quality data is one of them. According to a survey from Hitachi Vantara, 41% of U.S. respondents agree that successful AI projects rely on high quality data. This information actively demonstrates that bulidng a project related to artificial intelligence not only requires the implementation of algorithms but also intensive training using tons of data. Under this situation, I can imagine the demand for data storage for all tech companies and even other related fields will increase in the next few years. 

This article also mentions the security and privacy issues. The author mentions that 'the adoption of AI depends very heavily on trust of users...' This reminds me of the incoming Apple Intelligence, which can reads the emails or text messages on your iPhone and send you notifications. I believe it can do much more than that in the future. Due to the region settings I do not get the chnance to use AI on my cellphone by far. Although this sounds exciting to me and I belive it will provide lots of convenience for iPhone uses in their daily life, I concerns about my privacy at the same time. I believe it's necessary to set a boundary where AI can have my information but no more that. This is the main reason most users are not comfortable with AI.

**Comment from Joylyn Gong:**  
I found this article insightful because even with the prominent rise of artificial intelligence in 
entertainment industries, education, and search engines, there has also been a rise in concern with 
privacy. This has been a significant discussion in politics when looking into data collection and 
surveillance. In the U.S. especially, we are seeing this with misinformation and for there to be more 
regulation to mediate the situation after the 2024 Presidential Election.
